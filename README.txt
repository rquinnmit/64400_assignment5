 - I did not collaborate

 - No references. I used LLMs to reformat and write comments for code.

 - No known problems

 - I did the PCF (3%) to reduce the aliasing, bilinear texture filtering with mip-mapping (3%), the orthographic projection matrix (3%) with limited scene vertices.

 - No comments
